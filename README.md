This project investigates how financial news influences stock market behavior by combining text analytics, sentiment modelling, and quantitative financial indicators. Through this work, I build a fully reproducible Python data-science environment linked with GitHub, explore financial news through comprehensive EDA, and analyze both text patterns and time-series trends. The project also allows me to compute common technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD, apply NLP techniques to extract sentiment from headlines, and evaluate how these sentiment scores correlate with daily stock returns. By the end of the analysis, the goal is to develop clear, evidence-based insights and communicate them in a concise, publication-style report.
